more kernel threads which run when no other runnable thread can be scheduled on a CPU.
(C) 100% in Priviledge, 0% in User.
(D) Base priority class is WIN32_IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS
(E)The priority class of the thread running in the idle process is Idle
(F)Dynamic Priority is 0.
(G)With the PView process viewer (PVIEW.EXE), you can examine and modify many characteristics of the processes and threads running on your system.
With PView, you can modify the status of processes running on your system. 
As a result, by using PView, you can stop processes and potentially halt the entire system.

(K) Those with percentage in Privileged and User time have 2 or more threads running.
